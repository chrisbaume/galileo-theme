Back in November, I went SCUBA diving in Mexico. The first week was spent on the island of Cozumel where my girlfriend
and I did ten dives, followed by dives in two [cenotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote) - 'The Pit' and 'Pet
Cemetery'. For all of the dives, I wore a head-mounted GoPro which recorded over nine hours of footage. I've spent the
last couple of weekends going through it all and putting the following video together. Hope you like it!
